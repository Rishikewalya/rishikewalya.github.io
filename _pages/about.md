<span class="small_font">I am a <b>Data Engineer at ICICI Bank</b> in the Data & Intelligence Platform division. I completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering from the <b>University of Mumbai</b> (GPA: 8.06/10). I am grateful to have worked with researchers including Prof. <a target="_blank" href="#">Sanjay Kumar Singh</a> at IIT Varanasi and Prof. <a target="_blank" href="#">Darakhshan Khan</a> at the University of Mumbai.
<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>Prior Experience.</b> I was a <b>Research Intern at IIT Varanasi</b> under Prof. Sanjay Kumar Singh, working on a Uni-Sign Language Model for Machine Translation. I also conducted research at the University of Mumbai on multimodal AI for cardiac risk prediction — my final year thesis, CardioCare. My work on distributed training reduced training time by 48.9% and my multimodal cardiac assistant outperformed GPT-3.5 by 15% on clinical benchmarks.
<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>Recognition.</b> I received the <b>Best Paper Award at IEEE IATMSI 2025</b> for my work on Diabetic Retinopathy, was a 2nd Runner-Up at Techno Kagaz 2024, and secured 3rd Position at ResCon 2024 at IIT Bombay among 100+ participants.

<h3>Research Interest</h3>

<span class="small_font">
What drives my research is the idea of building AI systems that move beyond theoretical performance and create measurable impact in real-world domains such as healthcare. I am particularly interested in designing intelligent systems that are not only accurate, but scalable, interpretable, and deployable in production environments.
<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In healthcare AI, this means developing multimodal models that can combine signals like ECG data and medical text to assist in risk prediction.
<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;My approach focuses on (1) building robust model architectures grounded in strong experimental validation, and (2) optimizing distributed training and data engineering pipelines to ensure these systems scale effectively. Ultimately, I aim to bridge research and production by creating AI solutions that are both technically rigorous and practically impactful.
