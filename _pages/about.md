<span class="small_font">
I am a <b>Machine Learning Engineer and Data Engineer at ICICI Bank</b>, working on large-scale AML and Risk data systems within the Data & Intelligence Platform. My work focuses on building scalable data pipelines, optimizing PL/SQL workflows, and deploying ML-powered analytics systems.

<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>Research & AI.</b> I actively work in applied AI research with publications in IEEE conferences. My research spans Healthcare AI, NLP, Multimodal Learning, and LLM-based systems. I have worked on ECG-based cardiac risk prediction, AI-generated review detection, and sign language translation systems.

<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>Technical Focus.</b> My interests lie at the intersection of scalable ML systems, distributed training, explainable AI, and real-world AI deployment in finance and healthcare.
